# how I did it
## Frontend

EJS
JQuery
Vanilla JavaScript
Bootstrap 4

I used a lightweight framework, EJS, together with JQuery
since I found it is likely to spend most of your time learning the framework instead
of building a web application 

## Backend

Socket.io
Express
Node.js
MongoDB
Mongoose
Passport
Flash
